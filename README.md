# waterLeakge Model using unsupervised and supervised learning methods
Focuses on developing a smart water leakage detection model using machine learning techniques. The approach combines both K-Means clustering for anomaly detection and supervised models such as the Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks for accurate leak classification.
