# Water Leakage Model Using Supervised and Unsupervised Methods💧

This repository showcases my research journey towards developing intelligent solutions for water leakage detection in smart water management systems, where I applied unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches independently. 

## Project Overview 📄
Water leakage in distribution networks poses a significant challenge to achieving sustainable water management in South Africa and worldwide. Through this research implementation, I explore how machine learning techniques can be used to detect potential leaks efficiently, enabling proactive maintenance and water conservation. 

## Implementation Phases 
1. Data Collection
   - The data used in the model was generated under a simulated environment (...)
2. Data Pre-processing
   - Data was processed, cleaned and analysed through EDA techniques.
3. L1 Regularisation was used for Feature Selection
4. Models
   4.1 Unsupervised Model
   - K-means clustering was utilised to detect anomalies and uncover patterns in dataset without labelled data. The approach provided initial insights into potential leak-prone areas.
   4.2 Supervised Models
     - Artificial Neural Network
     - Naive Bayes
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest

## Research Impact 🌍
The work contributes to sustainable water management research by providing a stepping stone towards an intelligent, data-driven framework for early leak detection, reducing water loss and operational costs.
